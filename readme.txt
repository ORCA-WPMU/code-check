== Description ==
This plugin is a fork of Theme Check created by Otto42 and pross. There are just a few checks more for CampusPress users.

**Note: Please, do not use this plugin if you don't have a site in CampusPress network.
You can found the original Theme Check [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/)**

The theme check plugin is an easy way to test your theme and make sure it's up to spec with the latest [theme review](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Review) standards and CampusPress standards.

The tests are run through a simple admin menu and all results are displayed at once. Before uploading any Theme to CampusPress, please make sure that you run the check and fix any WARNING you see. ALERTS, INFO, etc will need an additional check from CampusPress staff.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why does it flag something as bad? =

It's not flagging "bad" things, as such. The theme check is designed to be a non-perfect way to test for compliance with the [Theme Review](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Review) and CampusPress guidelines. Not all themes must adhere to these guidelines. The purpose of the checking tool is to ensure that themes uploaded to CampusPress meet the latest standards of WordPress themes and will work on a wide variety of sites.

This theme checker is not perfect, and never will be. It is only a tool to help theme authors, or anybody else who wants to make their theme more capable. All themes submitted to CampusPress are hand-reviewed by a team of experts. The automated theme checker is meant to be a useful tool only, not an absolute system of measurement.
